# WebSerials2Epub
 This program converts web serials to epub files.
 
 'webseriallist.json' is used to input titles, authors, and urls of web serials. The "prefix" variable is an optional field for sites that use internal links to navigate between pages.        
 
 'serialinfo.json' contains the HTML tags used to locate chapter titles, chapter contents, and links to the next page.
 
 Place urls you would like to skip in 'exclusionlist.txt'. This can be useful for skipping updates or guest chapters.
 
 Two web serials, Bitter by Moody and Citadel by Unillustrated, are pre-setup to show how the program is used. If you have trouble downloading any web serials, please open an issue on Github and I'll do my best to add support for it.
